"""Read-only probe answering the questions `docs/adr/0022` could not
settle without a live HPE OneView appliance.

No OneView call has ever been made against this code. There is no HPE
equivalent of Cisco's UCS Platform Emulator — the 60-day OneView trial is
a real appliance, not a hardware simulator, so with no HPE hardware
attached it enumerates nothing — which puts this collector in the same
unvalidated state ADR-0017 records for Intersight. Every field mapping
here was built from HPE's own API Reference and is unproven.

This tool settles, in one run against a real appliance:

1. Does paging get past `/rest/server-profiles`' documented 256 ceiling,
   or is the list truncated forever?
2. Do the top-level hardware fields (`memoryMb`, `processorCount`,
   `processorCoreCount`, `portMap`) populate on an **iLO 4** server, or
   does an iLO-4 server give us identity and nothing else?
3. What does `mpModel` actually contain, per generation?
4. Which `mpIpAddresses` entry is the reachable one, and is there always
   one?
5. What does the appliance do when `X-Api-Version` is omitted?
6. Does `serverName` contain anything on a host with no HPE AMS?
7. Do GPUs also appear under `/processors` as `ProcessorType: "GPU"`?
8. Do the GPU model strings OneView reports match this platform's GPU
   catalog, or does every HPE card report unknown VRAM?
9. **Does `processorCount * processorCoreCount` equal the real core
   count?** `/processors` reports each socket's `TotalCores`, so summing
   it is a direct check on the whole-system core mapping. If it
   disagrees, every server's core count is wrong fleet-wide.
10. Does `expand=all` return `PowerSupplies`, or does each server cost a
    `/powerSupplies` call? That is the difference between a ~15-request
    sweep and a ~2500-request one.

Writes nothing: no MongoDB connection, no ingest pipeline, no `Manager`
document, no POST other than the login it needs, and it logs out.

    uv run python -m tools.verify_oneview

Reads the same `INVENTORY_ONEVIEW_IP`/`_USERNAME`/`_PASSWORD` the
collector does, so if this works the collector can connect too.
