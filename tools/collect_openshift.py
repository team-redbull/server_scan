"""CLI: report which servers this cluster is using.

Runs *inside* a cluster, not against one. Deployed per-cluster by ArgoCD
(see `cronjobs/`), it reads its own API server through the pod's
ServiceAccount and writes `Server.openshift` for the servers it holds.

Two sources, one per CronJob:

    python3 -m tools.collect_openshift --source nodes
    python3 -m tools.collect_openshift --source agents

`nodes` runs in every cluster and reports its own worker nodes. `agents`
runs on an MCE hub and reports its Agents — bound to a hosted cluster, or
sitting in the hub's inventory bound to nothing.

Deliberately *not* a `ManagerType` inside `tools.run_collector`. That
tool's `_PROVIDER_FACTORIES` maps to `ServerInventoryProvider`, whose
whole contract is `list_servers() -> ProviderServer` — hardware records.
This produces no hardware and creates no servers: a cluster host that
matches nothing in the inventory is reported and skipped, because the
vendor collectors are the only thing entitled to say what exists.

Exit codes follow `run_collector`'s: 0 complete, 1 total failure,
2 not configured, 3 partial (some hosts matched nothing).
