"""The `health_policies` collection.

`policy_key` is the mechanism that solves the override problem the
platform spec poses: a site-scoped policy must be able to *replace* a
global default (not just add another alert alongside it), while unrelated
policies keep firing independently. Policies sharing a `policy_key` form a
family; within a family, only the highest-precedence member is evaluated
(see `app.domain.services.health.resolution`) — different keys are fully
independent and all evaluate. `policy_key` defaults to the policy's own id
when not explicitly shared, which is what makes "just add a policy" the
common case and "this policy replaces that one" an explicit, visible
choice (the same `policy_key` value) rather implicit merge logic.
