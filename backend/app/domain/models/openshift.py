"""Whether a server is in use, as OpenShift reports it.

Two jobs write here and nothing else does. Every cluster reports its own
worker nodes; each MCE reports its Agents, either bound to a hosted
cluster or unbound. `lifecycle_state` is the field to read before
trusting any other: `cluster_name` is set only when something claims the
server, and `mce_name` only by the MCE job.

**Kept strictly separate from `classification.Classification`, which is a
regex verdict on a hostname.** That separation is the platform's own rule
— a naming convention is not proof of cluster membership — and it is why
`InstallationType` and `OpenShiftState` are two enums rather than one.
`InstallationType` says what *kind* of server this is; this says whether
it is in use. When they disagree the server is misnamed or misplaced, and
that disagreement is the signal. Reconciling them silently would destroy
it.

Vendor collectors never touch this: `IngestService` carries the whole
object forward untouched on every ingest, exactly as it does
`maintenance`. A server's hardware and its cluster membership are
observed by different systems on different schedules, and neither is
entitled to blank the other's findings.

**Nothing ever reports a removal.** A server freed from a cluster simply
stops appearing in that cluster's node list, so `AVAILABLE` can never be
observed directly — it is what remains when no job claims a server. Each
job therefore reconciles the set it owns (the servers naming *its*
cluster) rather than only writing what it saw; see
`app.application.services.openshift_membership`.

A state retired from `OpenShiftState` decodes as `AVAILABLE` rather than
raising — narrowing a persisted enum is a migration, and ADR-0024 records
what skipping it cost.

Correlation is by **hostname**, not MAC. Metal3 binds an Agent to a host
via `bootMACAddress`, which would be the stronger key, but it is only
available through the `BareMetalHost` — and not every server has one, so
reading it would cover part of the fleet while looking complete. The
hostname is on the Agent itself. See the module above for the two-step
read that makes it work across vendors.

Five fields, and the five an earlier shape carried that were dropped:
`docs/adr/0024-openshift-cluster-membership.md`.

            an MCE holds the server but no cluster does. The identifier of
            a cluster, on its own: names are unique across this estate,

        mce_name (str | None): The MCE that reported it. Set by the MCE job
            only; `None` on a plain cluster node, which no MCE knows about.
        last_reported_at (datetime | None): When a job last claimed this
            server. Diagnostic rather than load-bearing: the reconcile is
            set-based, so nothing infers availability from this going
            stale.
