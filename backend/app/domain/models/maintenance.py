"""Maintenance state, embedded on `Server`.

Deliberately independent of both classification and health: a server can
simultaneously be HOSTED_CLUSTER, CRITICAL, and in maintenance. Full CRUD
for maintenance (with its own audit trail) is a slice-4 concern; the shape
is declared now so it's part of the document from the start.
