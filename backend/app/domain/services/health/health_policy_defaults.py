"""Seeded system-default health policies.

`default_system_policies()` returns the platform spec's Cisco UCS fabric
acceptance scenario (§71) plus one generic storage default, ready to be
upserted by whatever integration step owns app-startup seeding (not this
module's job — see the module-level callers' docstrings for why this file
only *builds* the policies rather than persisting them).

The two fabric policies use DIFFERENT `policy_key`s
(`connectivity.fabric_paths_down_warning` /
`connectivity.fabric_paths_down_critical`) with mutually exclusive
conditions (`EQ 1` and `GTE 2`), matching the already-tested pattern in
`tests/unit/domain/services/test_health_evaluate.py`'s `FABRIC_POLICIES`
fixture: same `policy_key` means "these compete for one winner", and the
two severities here are meant to coexist as independent, simultaneously
registerable candidates, never to shadow each other.
