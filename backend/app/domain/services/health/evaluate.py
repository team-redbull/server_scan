"""Health policy resolution and evaluation.

This is where the platform spec's override requirement is actually solved:
a site policy must be able to *replace* a global default, defaults must be
disable-able per scope, and many unrelated policies must still fire
independently. See `app.domain.models.health_policy`'s module docstring
for the `policy_key` mechanism this implements.
