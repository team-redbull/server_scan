"""Text normalization for sort/search-safe fields.

Every function here is total (never raises, never returns `None` for a
non-null input) because the fields they populate
(`name_normalized`/`serial_normalized`/`model_normalized`) must always be
present — see `app.domain.models.server.Server`'s docstring on why that
matters for keyset pagination.

    Lowercase and collapse internal whitespace, for a `*_normalized` sort/filter field.

    Deliberately simpler than `build_search_tokens` (no splitting into
    tokens), since these fields are compared/sorted as whole strings, not
    searched.

    Args:
        value (str | None): The raw text, or `None`.

    Returns:
        str: The normalized text, or `""` for `None`/empty input.
