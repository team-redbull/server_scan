"""FastAPI dependency providers.

Resource *construction* (the Mongo/Redis clients) happens once in
`app.main`'s lifespan and is stashed on `app.state`; these dependency
functions only *retrieve* what's already there. This keeps route handlers
free of any global-singleton imports, which is what makes
`app.dependency_overrides` usable in tests without monkeypatching module
globals.

Every provider here is `async def`, not `def`, even though none of them
await anything — a sync dependency is still dispatched through Starlette's
`run_in_threadpool`, and an isolated A/B measured that handoff at
+0.14 ms per dependency (`docs/notes/2026-09-research-performance.md`
§7.4). `list_servers` alone pulls in three of these, so this was the
largest single measured cost in the read path with a one-keyword fix.
