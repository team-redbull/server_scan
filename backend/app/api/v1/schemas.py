"""API response schemas for `/api/v1/servers`.

Neither of these is the persistence model (`app.domain.models.server.
Server`) reused as-is — an explicit project requirement, not just a style
preference:

* `ServerSummary` is a deliberately lighter projection for list responses.
  At 10k+ servers, shipping the full `hardware` subdocument (CPU, every
  memory module, every drive, every PSU) on every row of a list response
  is pure waste — nothing in a list view renders it. `connectivity.facts`
  is the one exception kept in the summary: it's small (four scalars) and
  drives a fabric-health column in the list UI, so leaving it out would
  just cause the frontend to issue a detail fetch per row.
* `ServerDetail` is a field-for-field superset of `Server` today, but it's
  still its own model rather than `Server` returned directly, for two
  concrete reasons: (1) `Server.id` is aliased to `_id` for MongoDB, and
  FastAPI's default `response_model_by_alias=True` would serialize that
  alias straight into the API response, leaking a Mongo-ism into the
  public contract; (2) returning the persistence model directly means any
  storage-only field added to `Server` in a later slice is silently
  exposed over the API with no seam to stop and ask "should this be
  public?" — a dedicated response schema is that seam, even when today it
  happens to mirror every field.
