"""`/api/v1/health-policies`: read-only listing and lookup, and `/api/v1/health-metrics`.

Follows the same thin-router pattern as `app.api.v1.servers`: dependency
providers construct repositories/services from what's already on
`app.state` (never a module-level global holder), routes stay free of
business logic, and every domain-facing error is an `AppError` subclass —
never a raw `HTTPException` — so it renders through the shared RFC 9457
handler in `app.exception_handlers`.

Health policies are read-only (`27b20a8`, `f9ab059`): they ship with the
platform and are seeded/validated at startup
(`app.application.services.bootstrap`, via
`app.application.services.health_policy_service.validate_policy_write`),
never created or edited through this router.

The metric registry is built once at import time (`_METRIC_REGISTRY`)
rather than per-request or off `app.state`: `build_default_registry()` is
a pure, deterministic function over a fixed set of ~11 core metric
definitions (see `app.domain.services.health.metrics`'s own docstring on
why it's constructed explicitly rather than kept as global mutable
state) — a module-level constant here is that same "construct once,
pass explicitly" discipline, just scoped to this router instead of
`app.main`'s lifespan, since nothing about it depends on settings or a
live connection the way Mongo/Redis holders do.
