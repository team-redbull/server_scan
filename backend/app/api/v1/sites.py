"""`GET /api/v1/sites` — the fixed site list and per-site statistics.

Sites are a closed set loaded from `INVENTORY_SITES` (see ADR-0018),
not rows a user creates, so this endpoint always returns every one in a
stable order whether or not any server currently reports one. A site with
zero servers renders as an empty site, never as a missing card — "site
four has nothing in it" and "site four does not exist" are different
facts and the UI should be able to tell them apart.

The `unassigned` bucket at the end counts servers whose name carries no
site token (see `app.domain.value_objects.site`). It is deliberately
surfaced rather than hidden: a growing unassigned count is how a naming
drift becomes visible.

Each site also reports the same counts sliced by installation type, which
is what lets the landing page show fleet-wide UPI and hosted-cluster
cards without a second query.
