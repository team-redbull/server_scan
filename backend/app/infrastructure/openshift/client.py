"""The Kubernetes API, read from inside the cluster the job runs in.

`httpx` against `kubernetes.default.svc` rather than a Kubernetes SDK.
Every SDK worth using pulls `google-auth`, `oauthlib`, `requests` and
`websocket-client` behind it, which is a real supply-chain decision in an
air-gapped mirror — ADR-0017 rejected a large SDK on the same grounds —
and this needs two GETs. `httpx` is already a dependency and every other
HTTP collector here uses it.

In-cluster auth is two files, so there is no kubeconfig to parse and no
YAML parser to add: a bearer token and a CA bundle, both mounted by
Kubernetes into every pod with a ServiceAccount token.
