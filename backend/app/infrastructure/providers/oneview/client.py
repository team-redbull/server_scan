"""Async HTTP client for one HPE OneView appliance.

Hand-rolled on `httpx` rather than the `hpeOneView` SDK: the protocol is
one POST for a token, one header, and paginated GETs, while the SDK is
synchronous, depends on `future` and pins `docutils<0.18` across the
whole environment. See docs/adr/0022-oneview-only-hpe-collector.md,
"Decision 2".

Three behaviours here are not obvious and are the ones that break a
collector silently rather than loudly:

* `X-Api-Version` is required on every call, discovered from the
  unauthenticated `GET /rest/version`, and **clamped** to the newest
  version this code was written against.
* `count=-1` means *64* on `/rest/server-profiles`, not "all", so an
  explicit page size is always sent.
* A page loop that trusts `nextPageUri` alone cannot tell truncation
  from completion, so `get_all` compares what it fetched against the
  collection's own `total` and logs loudly when they disagree.

All three are documented in docs/hpe-collectors.md with their sources.
