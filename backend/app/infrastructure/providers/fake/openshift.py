"""Fake OpenShift membership, assigned after ingest.

Separate from `..fake.generator` on purpose, and the separation is the
point rather than tidiness: a collector produces a `ProviderServer`, which
has no `openshift` field at all, because cluster membership is observed by
a different system on a different schedule. Seeding it through the
provider would model a data path that does not exist.

So this runs where the real jobs run: over servers already in the
database, reading what is there. It stands in for the two CronJobs
`tools.collect_openshift` drives — every cluster listing its own worker
nodes, and each MCE listing its Agents — for a deployment with no clusters
to point at.

Deterministic per server rather than per run: the state is drawn from a
`Random` seeded on the server's own id, so re-running the seeder over the
same fleet produces the same answer without depending on iteration order.
