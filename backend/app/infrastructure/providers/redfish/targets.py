"""The standalone Redfish collector's fleet list and credential chain.

No network and no mapping: this module turns an operator's TOML into
validated `RedfishTarget`s, or fails the run before a single packet is
sent. That ordering is the point — a fan-out collector must not discover
a configuration error on host 380 of 400, and a credential must never be
presented to a host that a typo put it in front of.
