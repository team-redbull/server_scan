    Convert one compute unit and its descendants into a `ProviderServer`.

    Cisco collectors unchanged — only `provider_type` differs between them.

        server_mo (Any): The `computeBlade` or `computeRackUnit` MO.
        manager_id (str): The manager this server is reported under.
        profile_by_dn (dict[str, Any]): Service profile DN -> `lsServer`.
        template_dn_by_name (dict[str, str]): Template name -> DN.
        mgmt_if (Any | None): The server's own `mgmtIf`, or `None`.
        mgmt_ip_by_parent_dn (dict[str, Any]): Every domain
            `vnicIpV4PooledAddr`/`vnicIpV4StaticAddr` with a real address,
            from `ucs_common.management_ip_by_parent_dn`.
        ext_eth_ifs (list[Any]): Its `adaptorExtEthIf` MOs (physical
            uplinks).

            vNICs).
        cpu_units (list[Any]): Its `processorUnit` MOs.
        disk_units (list[Any]): Its `storageLocalDisk` MOs.
        switches_by_id (dict[str, Any]): Domain `networkElement` MOs
            keyed by `id` (`"A"`/`"B"`), passed through to `_attachments`.
        psu_units (Iterable[Any]): Its `equipmentPsu` MOs. Only populated
            for a rack-mount server — a blade's PSUs belong to its shared
            chassis, not to the blade, and `equipmentPsu` carries no
            relationship a blade could join through. Defaults to `()`
            rather than being required, unlike every other sub-resource
            argument here, so the many existing call sites that predate
            this field did not all need updating for it.
        card_units (Iterable[Any]): Its `graphicsCard` MOs (GPUs).
            Defaults to `()` for the same reason `psu_units` does.
        provider_type (str): Which collector observed this server.

    Returns:
        ProviderServer: The vendor-neutral DTO the ingest pipeline consumes.
