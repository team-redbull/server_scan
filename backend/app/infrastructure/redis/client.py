"""Redis client lifecycle.

One connection pool per process, created at startup. Redis is an ephemeral
cache only (see `app.infrastructure.redis.cache`): every code path that
reads from Redis must have a MongoDB fallback, so a Redis outage degrades
request latency rather than causing request failure. That contract is
enforced here by never letting a Redis error escape `ping()`, and by the
`CacheClient` wrapper (added in the caching slice) catching every Redis
exception at the call site.
