"""Structured logging via structlog.

structlog is the 2026-standard choice for async Python services over a
hand-rolled `logging.Formatter`: it gives bound loggers that carry request
context (request_id, server_id, ...) across a call chain without threading
it through every function signature, and a processor pipeline that renders
JSON in production and a readable console format in development from the
same log calls.

FastAPI, Uvicorn, and PyMongo all log through the stdlib `logging` module.
So that *all* logs — ours and theirs — end up as consistent JSON lines
sharing one schema, stdlib logging is routed through structlog's
`ProcessorFormatter` rather than run as a second, separately configured
pipeline (the "dual pipeline" mistake that produces two different log shapes
in the same service).

Never logged, even if passed as a field: raw request bodies, Authorization
headers, tokens, or credentials. `_drop_sensitive_keys` is the last line of
defense if a value with one of those names is ever passed by mistake.

    Recursively drop `_SENSITIVE_KEYS` from a value, at any nesting depth.

    A bare top-level check catches `logger.info("x", password=...)` but
    not a nested payload — an exception's own `args`, a vendor API's
    error body, a dict passed through as one field's value — so a
    credential inside any of those reached the log line unredacted. Lists
    are walked too, since a collector's per-host error list is exactly
    the shape a credential would arrive nested inside.
