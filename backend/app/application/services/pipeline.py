"""
Maps engine results onto the small embedded models a `Server` document persists.

`ClassificationResult` -> `Classification`, `HealthState` -> `Health`.

A dedicated mapping module rather than inlining this in `ingest.py`: the
engines' result types carry engine-internal detail (conflicts, per-leaf
evidence, shadowed/suppressed families) that's useful for an audit trail
or a "why is this WARNING" UI panel later, but the embedded `Server.
classification`/`Server.health` fields are deliberately small summaries —
keeping the mapping in one place means that summary boundary is enforced
in exactly one spot, not re-decided at every call site.
