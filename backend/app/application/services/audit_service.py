"""
The one path through which an audit event is ever recorded.

No other code in this codebase constructs an `AuditEvent` or calls
`MongoAuditEventRepository.record()` directly — every mutation that needs
an audit trail (classification rule CRUD, health policy CRUD,
classification/health changes, maintenance changes) goes through
`AuditService.record()`, so the id-generation, timestamping, and "which
repository method actually persists this" decisions live in exactly one
place.
