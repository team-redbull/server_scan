"""Reconcile one cluster's view of which servers it holds.

This service only ever touches `Server.openshift`, `revision` and
`updated_at` — the same discipline `MaintenanceService` follows, and the
reason a server can be simultaneously `HOSTED_CLUSTER`, `CRITICAL`, in
maintenance and `INSTALLED` without four writers fighting over one
document.

Deliberately not `IngestService`. That service rebuilds a whole `Server`
from a `ProviderServer` and replaces the document; routing cluster
membership through it would blank `name`, `identity.external_ids`,
`network.interfaces` and `connectivity`, none of which a cluster knows
anything about.

**Why this reconciles a set rather than writing what it saw.** Nothing in
Kubernetes reports a *removal*: a server freed from a cluster simply stops
appearing in its node list. A job that only wrote its observations would
leave every server it ever saw marked `INSTALLED` forever. So each run
also frees the servers that still name this cluster but were not seen this
time — and only those, which is what makes it safe for a job that can see
one cluster to run alongside jobs that see others.
