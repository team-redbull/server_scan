"""
Idempotent seeding of system-default classification rules and health policies.

Validated the same way a hand-authored write would be.

Both `default_system_rules()` and `default_system_policies()` generate a
fresh random id on every call, so re-running them and unconditionally
upserting would collide on each collection's unique `name` index on every
startup after the first. Seeding is therefore keyed on `name`, and an
existing document keeps its id, its stats and its `enabled` flag — the one
field a system rule/policy allows an admin to change.

Both go one step further: a system rule/policy's *definition* is re-synced
from code on startup when it has drifted. A default rule's pattern is
generated from `SiteCode` (see
`app.infrastructure.mongodb.classification_rule_repository`), so renaming
a site changes it — and seed-only-if-missing would have left every
existing deployment matching hostnames for sites that no longer exist,
silently, with nothing in the UI to suggest the rule was stale. Health
policies carry no site-derived state today, but the same drift is possible
by construction (a future code change to a default's condition/template)
and there is no editor UI left to notice or correct it by hand, so the
same re-sync applies.

Every rule/policy that would be written — seeded or re-synced — is run
through `validate_rule_write`/`validate_policy_write` first. Those were
originally write-time validation for the (now-removed) create/update API
routes; since rules and policies are read-only and bootstrap is the only
remaining writer, running them here is total coverage of what can ever be
persisted, not a narrower substitute — a malformed shipped default now
fails fast at startup instead of silently miscompiling or misevaluating
later.
