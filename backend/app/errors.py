"""Application error model.

Every raised `AppError` becomes an RFC 9457 ("Problem Details for HTTP
APIs") response via the handlers in `app.exception_handlers`:

    {
      "type": "/problems/revision-conflict",
      "title": "Revision Conflict",
      "status": 409,
      "detail": "The record was modified since you last read it.",
      "instance": "/api/v1/servers/srv_abc123",
      "code": "REVISION_CONFLICT",
      "request_id": "req_...",
      "details": {"current_revision": 5}
    }

RFC 9457 is the current IETF standard for HTTP API error bodies and is what
API-consuming tooling increasingly expects by default; `type`/`title`/
`status`/`detail`/`instance` are its fixed members, served with content-type
`application/problem+json`. `code`, `request_id`, and `details` are RFC 9457
"extension members" (explicitly permitted by the spec) that give this API's
own UI and any future automation a stable, machine-matchable error code on
top of the standard envelope — `code` never changes across a message
wording tweak, where `title`/`detail` might.

`type` is a relative reference (`/problems/<slug>`), not a dereferenceable
absolute URL — RFC 9457 explicitly allows this, and an air-gapped platform
has no public domain for it to resolve against anyway.

`ErrorCode` is an append-only registry: new codes are added at the end of
their section, and existing codes are never renumbered or removed once
shipped, since clients may match on them.
