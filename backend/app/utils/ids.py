"""Application-generated document identifiers.

We never use MongoDB's ObjectId as the public `_id`: prefixed, opaque ids
(`srv_...`, `site_...`) are self-describing in logs and URLs, and keep the
domain layer free of any MongoDB-specific type. Uniqueness comes from
`uuid4`; ordering (when needed) comes from `created_at`, not from the id
itself, so we deliberately avoid taking on a ULID dependency for Phase 1.
