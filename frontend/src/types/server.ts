/**
 * Hand-written types mirroring the backend's `/api/v1/servers` JSON shapes.
 * Deliberately decoupled from any generated OpenAPI client: the UI only
 * needs a subset of the persisted document, and hand-written types let us
 * keep that subset honest instead of importing the backend's full internal
 * model.
 *
 * **The one rule that matters here**: FastAPI serialises Python `None` as
 * JSON `null` and never omits the key (no `response_model_exclude_none`
 * anywhere in `backend/app`), so a Pydantic field typed `X | None` is
 * `X | null` on the wire — not `X | undefined`. Declaring one of those
 * optional-only makes `x !== undefined` look like a sufficient guard, and
 * `null.toFixed()` then unmounts the page (commit 1a896af). Every field
 * below is therefore typed from its backend counterpart:
 *
 * - `X | null` — the model field is `X | None`. Always sent, may be null.
 * - `X` — the model field has a non-null default. Always sent, never null.
 * - `?:` — reserved for keys the API genuinely may not send at all.
