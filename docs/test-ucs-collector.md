# Testing the UCS collector against a real environment

A step-by-step runbook for proving the Cisco collector actually reaches
your hardware and returns the servers you expect — in an air-gapped
environment, without writing anything until you choose to.

The steps are ordered so the **cheapest failure comes first**: step 1
needs nothing but network access to UCS Central, step 2 adds MongoDB and
logs into every domain, and only step 3 writes. If step 1 fails there is
no point running step 2.

There is exactly one Cisco collector — `--manager-type UCS_CENTRAL`. It
uses UCS Central to discover which domains exist and what service
profiles they hold, then reads each domain's real inventory from that
domain's own UCS Manager. `--manager-type UCS_MANAGER` is not a runnable
collector and will tell you so. See `cisco-collectors.md` for the
mechanics and `adr/0014-ucs-central-multi-domain-collector.md` for why.

## 0. Configuration

Five values, set in `.env` or exported. Note there is **no**
`INVENTORY_UCS_MANAGER_IP` — Central supplies every domain's address, so
only the UCS Manager *login* is configured.

```bash
export INVENTORY_UCS_CENTRAL_IP=ucsc.example.com      # bare host or IP
export INVENTORY_UCS_CENTRAL_USERNAME=inventory-svc
export INVENTORY_UCS_CENTRAL_PASSWORD='...'
export INVENTORY_UCS_MANAGER_USERNAME=inventory-svc
export INVENTORY_UCS_MANAGER_PASSWORD='...'
export INVENTORY_COLLECTOR_NAME_PATTERN='^ocp'
```

Two things that will waste your morning if you get them wrong:

- **The IP must be a bare hostname or address.** Not `https://ucsc...`,
  not `ucsc...:443`. Both SDKs build the URL themselves, so a scheme
  produces `https://https://host:443`. The collector rejects both up
  front rather than failing later as an opaque connection error.
- **The UCS Manager account must authenticate against *every* registered
  domain.** It is one service account used many times, not one per
  domain. A domain that rejects it is skipped so the rest of the fleet
  still collects, but the run ends `PARTIAL` and exits `3` — see
  "When a run comes back PARTIAL".

Optional: `INVENTORY_UCS_CENTRAL_DOMAIN_CONCURRENCY` (default `4`) caps
how many domains are read at once.

## 1. Read-only probe — no database required

```bash
uv run python -m tools.verify_ucs_central --show-names 20
```

Start here. It talks only to UCS Central, needs **no MongoDB**, writes
nothing, and answers the one question the whole design depends on:
does Central list the service profiles that name your servers?

It prints registered domains with their sync state, the `ownership_state`
breakdown across every `lsSPMeta` (a non-zero `localized` count means
Central does hold domain-local profiles), how many servers resolve a
name, how many match your name pattern, and a verdict:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `GOOD` | every collected server resolved a service-profile name |
| `PARTIAL` | some did — the message says how many of how many |
| `BAD` | none did; every server would fall back to a chassis-slot DN, carry no site token, and fail the name filter |

`--show-names N` prints the first N resolved names as a spot check
(default 10, `0` to disable). Read them: they are what site parsing,
classification and `INVENTORY_COLLECTOR_NAME_PATTERN` all key off.

**What this step cannot tell you:** it never logs into a UCS Manager, so
it says nothing about whether your UCSM credentials work per domain, and
nothing about the hardware detail the collector actually ingests. That is
step 2.

If this reports `BAD` or `PARTIAL`, record the result in
`adr/0014-ucs-central-multi-domain-collector.md` — its "What is still
unproven" section is waiting on exactly this answer.

## 2. Dry run — the real path, still writing nothing

```bash
uv run python -m tools.run_collector --manager-type UCS_CENTRAL --dry-run --limit 5
```

This is the first command that logs into each domain's UCS Manager. It
prints the `ProviderServer` each domain reports — identity, CPU, memory,
storage drives, BMC address, NIC MACs, fabric attachments, and which site
each name resolves to — *before* the ingestion pipeline reshapes any of
it. Nothing is classified, health-evaluated, audited or upserted.

> **`--dry-run` still needs MongoDB reachable.** It writes nothing, but
> the process connects and issues a `ping` before the dry-run branch runs,
> so an unreachable database fails the command at startup. That failure is
> not a UCS problem — check `INVENTORY_MONGO_URI` before suspecting the
> collector.

`--limit N` stops after N servers per run, which is what makes this cheap
to iterate on. To see the raw XML on the wire, add `--debug-xml` — pair it
with `--limit 1`, it is extremely verbose. Passwords are masked by the SDK.

Drop `--limit` once it looks right, to see the full set the run would
ingest.

## 3. The real run

```bash
uv run python -m tools.run_collector --manager-type UCS_CENTRAL
```

Classify, health-evaluate, audit and upsert — one write per server. It
prints a summary line:

```
manager=ucs-central fetched=412 created=412 updated=0 errors=0
```

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | complete — every registered domain was collected, every server ingested |
| `1` | the run failed outright (see logs) |
| `2` | configuration is missing — the message names the exact environment variables to set, rather than making you guess |
| `3` | **partial** — servers were written, but this run did not see the whole fleet |

A `3` is the one worth wiring an alert to; see "When a run comes back
PARTIAL" below.

### In-cluster

The collector runs as a CronJob. To trigger one immediately rather than
waiting for its schedule:

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<release>-collector-ucs-central ucs-manual-1
kubectl logs -f job/ucs-manual-1
```

Replace `<release>` with your Helm release name. Delete the job when done
(`kubectl delete job ucs-manual-1`) so a repeat run can reuse the name.

## 4. Reading the logs

Structured JSON, one event per line. The ones that matter:

| Event | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| `ucs_central.domain_plan` | how many domains will be collected vs skipped |
| `ucs_central.domain_summary` | per domain: `total_physical_cnt` (what Central claims it holds) against `collected_servers` (what its UCS Manager actually returned). `None` means never contacted, `0` means contacted and empty — these are different problems |
| `ucs_central.domain_collected` | one line per domain that succeeded, with its server count |
| `ucs_central.domain_failed` | a domain that errored — login rejected, unreachable, timed out |
| `ucs_central.domain_without_address` | a registered domain with no address to connect to |
| `ucs_central.domain_collected_nothing` | Central reported servers, its UCS Manager returned none |
| `collector.name_filter_applied` | `kept` and `skipped` counts for `INVENTORY_COLLECTOR_NAME_PATTERN` |
| `collector.partial_run` | **error level.** The run was incomplete: `unreachable` domains and `ingest_errors` servers. This is the one to alert on |

Interpreting the name filter, which is the usual source of an
unexpectedly empty inventory:

- `kept=0 skipped=900` — you reached the fleet; your pattern is wrong.
- `kept=0 skipped=0` — you reached nothing. Wrong endpoint, or every
  domain failed.

## When a run comes back PARTIAL

A domain that fails is logged and skipped so the rest of the fleet still
collects — one unreachable domain must not cost the other nine their
collection. But the run no longer *reports* that as success. It prints a
`PARTIAL` block naming what it could not reach and exits `3`:

```
manager=ucs-central fetched=380 created=0 updated=380 errors=0
manager=ucs-central PARTIAL — this run did not see the whole fleet:
  - domain dc2-fabric (10.20.0.5) failed after 0 server(s): Login to 10.20.0.5 failed: ...
```

Read each line as: which domain, at what address, how far it got before
failing, and why. `failed after 0 server(s)` with a login error is a
credential or firewall problem; `failed after 137 server(s)` with a
timeout is the domain going away mid-collection.

Two things trigger `PARTIAL`:

- **A domain that could not be collected** — login rejected, unreachable,
  timed out, or registered with Central but reporting no address to
  connect to at all.
- **Servers that failed to ingest** — `summary.errors` above zero. The
  collector reached them; something downstream rejected them (an
  unrecognised vendor, for instance).

**The distinction that matters: skipped is not failed.** A domain is
*skipped* when Central lists profiles for it and none match your name
pattern. That is the pruning working as designed — it is not an error and
deliberately does **not** turn the run red, because a fleet where only two
of eight domains hold `ocp` servers is normal, not broken. Only a domain
that *should* have been readable and was not counts against the run. If a
domain you expected is missing, check `ucs_central.domain_plan` to see
whether it was skipped rather than failed.

A domain for which Central lists *no* profiles at all is always collected,
never skipped, precisely so an incomplete replica cannot silently shrink
your fleet.

### In Kubernetes

A non-zero exit fails the pod, so a partial run shows as a failed Job
rather than a green one, and is retried per the CronJob's `backoffLimit`.
**A retry is safe**: ingestion is an idempotent upsert keyed on vendor
plus serial, so re-collecting the domains that already succeeded rewrites
the same documents rather than duplicating them. If the failure was
transient the retry simply completes; if it was a bad credential the Job
keeps failing, which is the point.

### Cross-checking by hand

The `PARTIAL` block is now the primary signal, but these still work as a
sanity check against a log file:

```bash
# every domain that succeeded — should equal the number you expect
grep ucs_central.domain_collected <logfile> | wc -l

# every domain that did not
grep ucs_central.domain_failed <logfile>
```

## 5. Confirming the data landed

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/servers | head
curl -s 'localhost:8080/api/v1/servers?site_id=one' | head
```

Or open the UI, whose landing page is a per-site overview — a site showing
"Unassigned" servers means those names carried no recognisable site token,
which is a naming problem rather than a collector one.

## Air-gapped notes

Nothing here reaches the internet at runtime. Both Cisco SDKs
(`ucsmsdk`, `ucscsdk`) are ordinary Python packages installed from your
mirror; see `air-gap.md` for mirroring `requirements.txt` / `pylock.toml`
and the container base images. In-cluster the collector runs the same
image as the API — `tools/` is copied in alongside `app/` specifically so
no second image is needed.

The collector makes outbound HTTPS (443) connections to UCS Central and
to **every** registered UCS Manager. If your egress rules are per-host,
Central alone is not enough; each domain's Fabric Interconnect address
needs to be reachable from the collector pod too. Step 2 is what proves
that, and `ucs_central.domain_failed` is what a missing rule looks like.
