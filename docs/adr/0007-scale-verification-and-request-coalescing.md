# ADR-0007: Query plans are verified against real 10k/50k data, not fixture-sized data; list reads are request-coalesced

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The platform's stated performance target is ~10,000 servers with headroom
to 50,000+ (`docs/architecture.md`'s "Purpose" section). Every index in
`app.infrastructure.mongodb.indexes` was designed with that scale in mind
and spot-checked with `.explain()` against small integration-test fixtures
(dozens of documents). That's not the same thing as verifying it: MongoDB's
query planner is a cost-based optimizer, and at a few dozen documents it
will happily choose a full collection scan over a barely-selective index
because the scan is *actually cheaper* at that size — a fixture-sized
`.explain()` assertion can pass for a query shape that silently regresses
to a collection scan once the collection is large enough that the index
would have mattered.

`tools/seed_inventory.py` was timed and found to scale linearly (~5.5ms/
server end-to-end, including classification and health evaluation) —
50,000 servers seed in well under 5 minutes — so seeding real-scale data
for verification is cheap enough to do routinely, not just once. Two new
tools do the actual verification:

- `tools/verify_indexes.py` runs `.explain()` for every query shape
  `GET /api/v1/servers` (and the classification/health resolution and
  audit-event paths) can issue, against whatever is currently seeded, and
  fails loudly if a shape that has a supporting index falls back to an
  unexpected `COLLSCAN` anyway.
- `tools/loadtest.py` measures real p50/p95/p99 latency for the same
  shapes under concurrent load against a running API instance — plan
  shape alone doesn't say whether 6,000 examined keys is 5ms or 500ms on
  real hardware, or what happens when many callers hit the same expensive
  shape at once.

Run against a genuine 50,000-document `servers` collection, both tools
found real problems that fixture-sized tests had not (and structurally
could not have) caught:

### 1. `last_seen_at`'s index was missing its `_id` tiebreak

Every other unfiltered-sort index in `SERVER_INDEXES` — `name_id`,
`serial_id`, `model_id`, `updated_at_id` — is `(sort_field, _id)`, matching
the pattern keyset pagination needs (see `indexes.py`'s module docstring).
`last_seen_at`'s index shipped as `(last_seen_at)` alone. MongoDB cannot
use a single-field index to satisfy a `.sort([(last_seen_at, 1), (_id,
1)])` — the compound sort key isn't a prefix of what the index provides —
so an unfiltered `sort=last_seen_at` request fell back to a full
`COLLSCAN` plus a blocking in-memory sort. Fixed by replacing it with
`last_seen_at_id: (last_seen_at, _id)`.

### 2. `maintenance.enabled` — a whitelisted filter with no compound index

`app.domain.services.search.FILTER_FIELDS` whitelists `maintenance` (→
`maintenance.enabled`), and `indexes.py`'s own module docstring states the
design rule: "One compound index per filter whitelisted in
`FILTER_FIELDS`, each ending in the default sort field + `_id`." No such
index existed for `maintenance.enabled` — an oversight relative to the
module's own stated rule, not a deliberate omission. Filtering by
maintenance state (combined with the `last_seen_at` bug above, on that one
sort field specifically) fell back to a full `COLLSCAN`. Fixed by adding
`maintenance_enabled_name_id: (maintenance.enabled, name_normalized,
_id)`, matching every sibling filter index's shape.

Both were caught purely by running the exact same `.explain()` assertions
against 50,000 real documents instead of a test fixture; the query code
itself never changed, only the two index definitions.

### 3. Cache-stampede tail latency on `GET /api/v1/servers`

`tools/loadtest.py`, run at 20 concurrent callers against a low-selectivity
search term (`search=ocp-dell`, matching roughly a quarter of the 50k
fleet), showed a p50 of 30ms but a p95/p99 in the **4-second** range.
`app.infrastructure.redis.cache.CacheClient` is a plain cache-aside with no
deduplication: when many identical requests arrive within the same
15-second `LIST_PAGE_TTL_SECONDS` window before the first one has written
its result back, *every one of them* independently misses the cache and
independently re-runs the same multi-thousand-document Mongo scan — the
textbook cache-stampede / dogpile-effect failure mode. This is a realistic
scenario, not a synthetic one: a saved dashboard filter or a shared link
that many browser tabs/users poll at once produces exactly this request
pattern.

## Decision

Add in-process request coalescing (`app.infrastructure.singleflight.
coalesce`) around the cache-miss path in `GET /api/v1/servers`: concurrent
callers requesting the same cache key while a computation is already in
flight `await` that same in-flight `asyncio.Future` instead of issuing
their own redundant Mongo query. Deliberately scoped to a single process
(a plain `dict[str, asyncio.Future]`, no distributed/Redis lock) — a load
balancer already spreads concurrent requests for the same resource across
replicas, so per-process coalescing removes most of the duplicate work
without taking on a distributed lock's own contention and staleness
failure modes, and Phase 1 has no multi-worker deployment yet to even
measure cross-process contention against.

Re-running the same load-test scenario after the fix: p99 dropped from
~4,057ms to ~156ms — Mongo now does the expensive scan once per stampede
instead of once per concurrent caller.

## A related, deliberately undecided finding

The same load test surfaced a second, arguably more important tail-latency
case: a search term that matches **zero or very few** documents (e.g. a
mistyped hostname, or a search-as-you-type request sent before the user
has finished typing) cannot benefit from `list_page`'s early-stop
`limit(page_size + 1)` — with no matches to accumulate, the query must
examine the *entire* collection before it can conclude there's nothing
more to find. Measured at 50k: p99 ≈ 700-800ms for a non-matching search,
reproducible across repeated runs (not noise). Request coalescing doesn't
help here, since a mistyped or partially-typed search is rarely the exact
same string across concurrent callers.

This is a real, quantified characteristic, not a bug in the code added
this slice — it's inherent to `list_page`'s existing plan-selection
behavior (the sort field's index drives the scan; the search filter is
applied as an in-memory `FETCH`-stage regex check, so its cost is
proportional to how many documents must be examined before the sort order
happens to produce enough matches, which is unbounded when there are too
few). A real fix needs a genuine trade-off decision this ADR does not make
lightly: forcing the planner onto the `search_tokens` index (via `.hint()`
or a compound `(search_tokens, name_normalized, _id)` index) bounds the
*filter* cost to the true match count, but MongoDB cannot use a multikey
index to also provide sort order for a non-equality condition on the
array field — so it would trade this problem for a blocking in-memory sort
whose cost scales with match count instead, which is *worse* for a
moderately common search term (thousands of matches) even though it's
much better for the empty/near-empty case this ADR is about. Changing this
touches the same query path `docs/adr/0006`'s cursor-pagination fix
already had to get exactly right; doing it under this slice's time budget
risked the correctness of an already-verified system for an
improvement whose net direction depends on real search-term distribution
this platform doesn't have production data for yet. Left as a documented,
quantified, deliberately open finding for a follow-up slice — not silently
absorbed into "performance pass: done."

## Consequences

- `tools/verify_indexes.py` and `tools/loadtest.py` are now part of the
  toolset for evaluating any future index or query-shape change — re-run
  both against a freshly `tools/seed_inventory.py --count 50000`-seeded
  database before trusting a fixture-sized `.explain()` assertion alone.
- `app.infrastructure.singleflight.coalesce` is a general-purpose,
  dependency-free primitive — any future endpoint with the same
  cache-aside-plus-expensive-recompute shape (not just `GET /servers`)
  should consider it, not just this one call site.
- The zero/near-zero-match search tail latency is accepted, quantified,
  and documented, not fixed, in this slice. It should be revisited once
  there's real production search-term distribution to reason about the
  hint-vs-current trade-off with, or if it starts showing up as a real
  operational complaint rather than a benchmark artifact.
