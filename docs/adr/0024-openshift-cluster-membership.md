# ADR-0024: cluster membership is reported by the clusters, per cluster, as a reconcile

Date: 2026-09-10
Status: Accepted

Supersedes nothing. `Server.openshift` has existed since Phase 1 and only
the fake seeder ever wrote to it; this is the decision about what fills it
and what it holds.

## Context

A server's only cluster signal was `Classification.installation_type`, a
regex verdict on its hostname. That says what a machine was *named* to be,
never whether anything is using it — a freed server and a running one are
byte-identical under it. "What can I build on" had no answer.

Nothing already in the platform could answer it either. Vendor managers
(UCS Central, Intersight, OME, OneView) know hardware, not workloads: to
UCS, a blade running a production cluster and a blade sitting idle are
both `associated`. Only the cluster knows.

## Decision

Two CronJobs, `tools/collect_openshift.py --source nodes|agents`, deployed
**per cluster** by ArgoCD from `deploy/helm/openshift-membership`. Every
cluster runs the nodes job over its own worker nodes; an MCE hub also runs
the agents job over its Agents.

They write `Server.openshift` and nothing else, the same discipline
`MaintenanceService` follows — which is what lets one server be
simultaneously `HOSTED_CLUSTER`, `CRITICAL`, in maintenance and
`INSTALLED` without four writers fighting over one document. Deliberately
not `IngestService`: that rebuilds a whole `Server` from a
`ProviderServer` and would blank `name`, `identity.external_ids`,
`network.interfaces` and `connectivity`, none of which a cluster knows.

### Why a reconcile, not a write of what was seen

**Nothing in Kubernetes reports a removal.** A server freed from a cluster
simply stops appearing in its node list. A job that only wrote its
observations would leave every server it ever saw `INSTALLED` forever, and
the inventory would never show free capacity again.

So each run reconciles **the set it owns** — the servers already naming
*its* cluster — claiming what it sees and freeing what it does not:

```
for observation in observations:        # on the cluster -> claim
    seen.add(server.id)
for server in claimed_by(scope):        # Mongo says this cluster...
    if server.id not in seen:           # ...but the cluster did not
        free(server)                    #    -> AVAILABLE
```

`scope` is `{"openshift.cluster_name": <this cluster>}` for a nodes job
and `{"openshift.mce_name": <this MCE>}` for an agents job. **That scope
is what makes per-cluster deployment safe**: a job can only ever release
servers that name its own cluster, so a broken job in one cluster cannot
free another's machines. A fleet-wide "anything I did not touch is
available" sweep would have cluster A's job free every server in clusters
B and C on every run, because it cannot see them.

### Two refusals

Both matter more than they look, and both exist because the reconcile
frees on absence:

- **A failed API read exits non-zero and writes nothing.** A read that
  failed is not evidence of an empty cluster.
- **A *successful* read returning nothing also refuses.** A cluster with
  no workers is far more likely a broken selector, an RBAC change or a
  mid-upgrade blip than a genuinely emptied cluster — and acting on it
  would free everything that cluster holds.

### Correlation is by hostname, in two steps

`spec.hostname` first, `status.inventory.hostname` as fallback. The order
is the whole reason it works across vendors: Cisco reports the server's
real name as its hostname, while Dell reports one derived from a MAC that
matches nothing — there the real name is only in the **requested**
hostname an operator set.

`clean_hostname` returns `None` rather than `""` for a blank value. A
present-but-empty requested hostname would otherwise short-circuit the
`or` and strand every Dell host.

**`BareMetalHost` is deliberately not read**, even though `bootMACAddress`
would be a stronger key than a hostname. Not every server has a BMH, so a
BMH lookup would cover part of the fleet while looking complete.

### Node selection: label *and* name, not either

Nodes are selected by `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker` and then filtered
by a configurable name list (default `infra,control-plane`). Both, because
infra nodes usually carry the worker label too — so the label alone keeps
them — while names alone would misfire on a node called
`compute-infra-01`.

## Decision 2: `httpx` against `kubernetes.default.svc`, not a Kubernetes SDK

Every SDK worth using drags `google-auth`, `oauthlib`, `requests` and
`websocket-client` into an air-gapped mirror, and this needs two GETs.
ADR-0017 rejected a large SDK on the same grounds. In-cluster auth is a
token file and a CA file, so there is no kubeconfig to parse and **no new
dependency at all**.

The Agent CRD's version is discovered at runtime rather than pinned, which
removes the one real advantage `oc get agents` had: the job keeps working
when MCE moves the CRD to v1.

## Decision 3: three states, and five fields

`OpenShiftState` is `AVAILABLE` / `INSTALLED` / `INSTALLED_TO_INVENTORY`,
replacing `UNKNOWN` / `UPI_NODE` / `HOSTED_NODE` / `AVAILABLE`.

The old shape encoded *what kind* of node a server is into its status,
which `InstallationType` already answers, and left the same fact reachable
two ways with no single value the inventory could filter on.

**There is deliberately no "nobody looked yet".** `AVAILABLE` is the
default and the only state reached by absence. A separate `UNKNOWN` would
be indistinguishable from "no cluster holds this" everywhere it is shown,
and every server has to answer the in-use question somehow.

`OpenShiftLifecycle` carries exactly five fields:

| Field | Why it is here |
|---|---|
| `lifecycle_state` | The question this model exists to answer |
| `cluster_name` | Which cluster. Unique across this estate, including across MCEs |
| `mce_name` | Which MCE reported it; `None` on a plain cluster node |
| `last_reported_at` | Diagnostic. The reconcile is set-based, so nothing infers availability from this going stale |
| `reported_by_agent_id` | Which job instance wrote this, for tracing a wrong value back |

An earlier shape carried five more. Each was dropped for its own reason:

- **`cluster_id`** — cluster names are unique across this estate, so an id
  disambiguates nothing.
- **`role`** — every server this platform tracks is a worker.
- **`node_name`** — it is the server's name, which is what the hostname
  correlation just proved.
- **`agent_id`, `bmh_name`, `boot_mac`** — cluster-side handles this
  inventory never follows. `bmh_name` and `boot_mac` were never populated
  at all, since BareMetalHost is not read.

Existing documents carrying the old values decode as-is; the jobs
overwrite them on first run, and the sites aggregation counts an
unrecognized state under `AVAILABLE` so slice totals still add up.

## Decision 4: kept separate from `Classification`, on purpose

`InstallationType` says what kind of server this is; `OpenShiftState` says
whether it is in use. **When they disagree the server is misnamed or
misplaced, and that disagreement is the signal.** Reconciling them
silently would destroy it. `IngestService` therefore carries the whole
`openshift` object forward untouched on every ingest, exactly as it does
`maintenance`: hardware and cluster membership are observed by different
systems on different schedules, and neither is entitled to blank the
other's findings.

## Deployment

A Helm chart, one release per cluster, replacing an earlier kustomize
base/overlay tree — ArgoCD points an `Application` per cluster at the
chart path and carries the few values that differ:

```yaml
# UPI cluster                    # MCE hub
nodes:                           nodes:
  enabled: true                    enabled: true
  clusterName: ocp4-tlv            clusterName: mce-tlv
                                 agents:
                                   enabled: true
                                   mceName: mce-tlv
```

`clusterName`/`mceName` are Helm `required` — a release without them fails
at template time rather than deploying a job that exits 2 on every
schedule. `agents.enabled` is off by default: a cluster with no Agent CRD
would run the job every 15 minutes and fail every time, turning a real
alert channel into noise. RBAC renders only the rule an enabled job needs,
so a UPI cluster gets no `agents` grant.

`concurrencyPolicy: Forbid`, not `Replace`: two overlapping reconciles
would race on the same servers, and the loser's release would undo the
winner's claim.

## Consequences

- Free capacity is a first-class, filterable fact
  (`?openshift_state=AVAILABLE`), and the sites landing page can show it.
- Every cluster needs network to the platform's MongoDB and a copy of the
  `mongo-uri` and `cursor-secret` Secrets. The jobs write directly, like
  every collector; they never call the platform's API.
- A cluster that stops running its job leaves its servers `INSTALLED`
  indefinitely. Nothing detects that yet — it is the same gap as
  collector staleness detection, still item 0 of the not-done list, and
  this feature adds two more CronJobs that it will need to cover.
- `INSTALLED_TO_INVENTORY` is only ever produced by the agents job, so an
  estate with no MCE will never see that state.
