"""Shared fixtures for tests against the live dev Mongo+Redis stack
(`scripts/dev-up.sh`). Every fixture here skips cleanly — never hangs —
when its backing service isn't reachable, so `pytest tests/integration`
degrades to a clear skip list instead of a timeout when the dev stack
isn't running.

The reachability check itself (the memoized "unreachable" reason,
remembered for the rest of the session so ~60 function-scoped, Mongo-backed
tests don't each pay `mongo_server_selection_timeout_ms` (5s) to rediscover
the same dead server) lives in `tests._stack_availability`, shared with
`tests/api/conftest.py` rather than duplicated — see that module's
docstring for the measured before/after (one file of 7 skips went from 35s
to part of a 5.22s run).
