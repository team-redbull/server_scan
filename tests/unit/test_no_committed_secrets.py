"""Guards that no real BMC credential or captured mockup reaches git.

`.gitignore` is a convenience — it does not stop `git add -f`, and it
does not help once a file is already tracked. This runs in the same CI
job as the rest of the suite and fails the build instead.

The exposure is specific to this platform. A Redfish credentials file is
a fleet-wide, root-equivalent secret, and an inventory or a raw
`Redfish-Mockup-Creator` capture discloses the estate's topology —
doubly so here, because this project encodes the site code in the server
name (`ocp4-prod-one-infra-01` -> site `one`). And committed is forever:
`git rm` does not remove a file from history.
