"""The Redfish client and provider, against a real HTTP fixture.

Hermetic: `tests.redfish_fixture` serves a mockup tree from stdlib
`http.server` on an ephemeral port, so these run with no hardware, no
network egress and no new dependency. It implements session auth, which
is why it is hand-rolled — neither `sushy-tools` nor DMTF's mockup server
does, so neither can exercise login, logout, or a rejected credential.

Covers every scenario the collector has to survive in production: a
healthy host, an unreachable one, a rejected credential, a host missing
optional properties, a malformed value, a partial fleet, and session
cleanup on both success and failure.
