"""Reading a cluster's own report of a host.

The hostname rules are the whole reason this design works across vendors,
and they are pure functions over the JSON a cluster returns — so they are
tested here rather than against a cluster.

The case that matters: Cisco reports the server's real name as its
hostname, Dell reports one derived from a MAC. On Dell the real name is
only in the **requested** hostname an operator set, so the requested one
has to win, and the reported one has to remain the fallback for everything
else.
