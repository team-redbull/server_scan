UCS and Intersight populated `ProviderServer.psus`; Redfish did not, so
Dell, DGX and every standalone server reported no power supplies at all

What is tested here is the vocabulary and the absent-bay rule, because
both have already caused a silent wrong answer in this codebase once —
see the dated comments in `app.domain.services.health.facts`.
