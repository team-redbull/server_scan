"""Guards that the frontend's copies of `ManagerType` do not drift from
the backend's.

The frontend has no way to learn the manager types at runtime — unlike
sites, which it reads from `GET /api/v1/sites` — so it carries hardcoded
copies. That is a defensible choice: a new `ManagerType` always requires
a provider implementation anyway, so it can never appear without a code
change. What is *not* defensible is the copies silently falling behind,
and they did: the Intersight collector shipped and its value was missing
from the inventory page's Source filter for six commits, which made a
whole collector's servers unfilterable in the UI with no error anywhere.

These read the actual `.tsx`/`.ts` sources rather than a generated
artifact, in the same spirit as `test_no_committed_secrets.py` — a
string-level check across the language boundary is worth more than the
elegance it costs.
