Two things are pinned here. Every default policy's condition must
reference a registered metric — a policy referencing an unknown metric is
rejected at save time, so a seeded one that did would fail at startup

And the vendor-neutrality claim: a check that only ever fires for one
vendor is not fleet coverage. `extract_facts` is fed servers built the way
each provider builds them, and the assertion is on what the facts say.
